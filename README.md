## My process

### Built with

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library




### What I learned

During my first frontend challenge I learnt a lot about responsive design, Learning to use tailwindCSS mobile-first approach was key in making the site responsive, Also learning to render out different components based on a form being valid or not was nice to learn without routing things to other pages.

Using email regex was a first for me and it was cool to do my own form validation instead of using the built in one makes a cleaner and more professional design, 

Overall I am very happy with how this turned out I know its not perfect but I enjoyed this challenege and will do more!







### Continued development

I want to refine my mobile-first approach I realised after making the desktop version it was quite tricky to make it mobile responsive as well so next time I want to try make the code cleaner I think I could cut down on a lot of css, 

Being smarter about my flex and grid would also be nice I learnt a lot in  this project but I think I can do better for the next challenge
